# Water Supply and Sanitation in Africa

## Overview

This project explores access to clean water and sanitation across African communities using SQL for data analysis. It aims to provide actionable insights to help governments, NGOs, and stakeholders improve public health and infrastructure.


## Problem Statement

Millions of Africans face limited access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, contributing to the spread of diseases and slowing development. Data gaps and poor analysis have hampered effective interventions.


## Objectives

Leverage SQL queries to analyze water and sanitation data, answer key business questions, and identify patterns that can guide strategic decisions.

## Tools Used
SQL

Word/MS Office – Documentation

## Recommendations:

Repair and expand water point infrastructure.

Prioritize disease-prone and underserved communities.

Support maintenance training for local teams.

Leverage data for policy-making and resource allocation.
